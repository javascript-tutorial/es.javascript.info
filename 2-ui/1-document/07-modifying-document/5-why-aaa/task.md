# Why does "aaa" remain?

In the example below, the call `table.remove()` removes the table from the document.

But if you run it, you can see that the text `"aaa"` is still visible.

Why does that happen?

```html height=100 run
<table id="table">
  aaa
  <tr>
    <td>Test</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<script>
  alert(table); // the table, as it should be

  table.remove();
  // why there's still aaa in the document?
</script>
```
