# DOM children

Look at this page:

```html
<html>
<body>
  <div>Users:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>John</li>
    <li>Pete</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

For each of the following, give at least one way of how to access them:
- The `<div>` DOM node?
- The `<ul>` DOM node?
- The second `<li>` (with Pete)?
